[00:08.04] Your mama used to worry 'bout that big muddy river
[00:12.16] Honey, do you remember?
[00:17.35] You let the screen door slam when you stepped off the front porch
[00:22.19] Hear your mama callin' "Don't you be late"
[00:25.22] And I'd hear your daddy holler, "Son, she's my only daughter"
[00:32.56] You'd stick your nose in the honey suckle down by the gate
[00:36.38] I can still hear you mama callin' "Don't go near the water"
[01:05.88] 
[00:44.15] We fell right in way over our heads
[00:47.96] But we didn't go near the water
[00:51.40] And love ran deep, so young and sweet
[00:55.67] And the nights got hotter and hotter
[00:59.33] We was sure 'nough gettin' our feet wet, mama
[01:03.20] But we didn't go near the water
[01:18.70] 
[01:12.28] We'd hear the rockin' chair squeakin' as we sneaked up the back stairs
[01:17.36] Mama waitin' like a grizzly bear
[01:20.53] We had to get the honey suckle out of your hair
[01:27.40] But in the mornin' light, we'd look her right in the eye
[01:31.85] It wasn't a lie, we didn't go near the water
[01:53.85] 
[01:38.91] And we fell right in way over our heads
[01:43.17] But we didn't go near the water
[01:47.21] The love ran deep, so young and sweet
[01:50.56] And the nights got hotter and hotter
[01:54.08] And we was sure 'nough gettin' our feet wet, mama
[01:58.49] But we didn't go near the water
[02:13.99] 
[02:06.17] Your mama used to worry 'bout that big muddy river
[02:10.31] She should've worried 'bout me
[02:25.31] 
[02:15.33] 'Cause we was sure 'nough gettin' our feet wet, mama
[02:19.12] But we didn't go near the water
[02:23.51] Didn't go near the water
[02:27.48] Didn't go near the water, yeah, yeah, yeah
